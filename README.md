# Exam Time and Instructions Display

Classrooms at large universities often come equipped with projectors,
screens, and other technology for instructional purposes.

This App displays a large timer along with exam instructions and
conditionally timed messages (e.g. Time's Up!). It is intended to put
on-screen during exams.
